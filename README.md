# Employ-Salary-Prediction
It is my 1st uploaded project in github. It is purely based on Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning.
follow the following info or step to know about this project:>

Data Preparation:
Synthetic data generation (or loading real data)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Data Preprocessing:
Handling categorical variables with Label Encoding
Feature scaling with StandardScaler
Train-test split

Model Training:
Multiple algorithms tested (Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVR)
Performance metrics calculation (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2)

Model Evaluation:
Comparison of different models
Feature importance analysis
Visualization of predictions vs actual values

Model Deployment:
Saving the trained model and preprocessing objects
Prediction function for new inputs
